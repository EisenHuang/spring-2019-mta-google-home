Lauren Lennox lives and works in New York City.She either moved to New York in her early twenties or has lived there her entire life. She is comfortable with technology, meaning that upon arrival at her parent's house, she is asked to help out with the wifi or other menial domestic IT issues.
 Last Christmas, Her parents saw a commercial for the google home and thought it would a nice gift for their helpful daughter. 
Lauren, like other modern twenty-year-olds, understands the moral dilemmna of having an always-listening block of device in her apartment. However, she finds it useful for spotify streaming and for answering "googleable" questions. 
Recently, she has been running late due to the L/4/5/6/any train having strange arrival times and often, she'll either arrive at the station having just missed the train or will be resigned to an 8-10 minute wait for the next one.
  Suggested by her friend to combat this, MTA for GH enables Lauren to ask her google home for the train's exact arrival times. Now, she's been more on time for things like work or meeting with friends, all of whom have noticed her improved promptness.
 When asked about what triggered this sea change , She'll smile, look at the camera and say, " You can thank MTA for Google Home!" With her new found sense of organization and timing, Lauren integrates MTA for Google Home into her daily routine and currently reports a higher quality of life.
